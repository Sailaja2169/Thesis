# Phishing Behavioral Cybersecurity Research Project

**The Role of Human Factors in Phishing Attacks: A Behavioral Cybersecurity Study**

## Project Overview

This research project investigates why phishing attacks continue to succeed despite advanced cybersecurity technologies, focusing on human behavioral factors, cognitive biases, and workplace contexts.

**ðŸ“… Timeline:** 13-week structured plan (see `plan.jpeg` for visual Gantt chart)  
**ðŸŽ“ Target:** MSc Thesis Excellence + IEEE Publication  
**ðŸ“Š Current Progress:** Week 3 of 13 (25% complete)

### Research Questions

1. How do cognitive biases (authority bias, urgency) affect phishing attack susceptibility?
2. To what extent do stress and multitasking increase phishing vulnerability in work contexts?
3. Does previous cybersecurity training reduce working professionals' vulnerability to phishing?
4. How do demographics (age, digital literacy, job role) correlate with phishing vulnerability?

## Key Innovations & Improvements

### 1. **Real-Time Phishing Detection System**
- Browser extension prototype for detecting phishing indicators
- ML-based URL analysis
- User behavior tracking

### 2. **Adaptive Training Platform**
- Personalized training based on individual vulnerability profiles
- Spaced repetition learning algorithms
- Context-aware simulations

### 3. **Comprehensive Analytics Dashboard**
- Real-time vulnerability metrics
- Organizational risk heatmaps
- Longitudinal training effectiveness tracking

### 4. **Advanced ML Models**
- Multi-factor vulnerability prediction
- Cognitive bias pattern recognition
- Contextual risk assessment

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip package manager
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure the project:
```bash
cp config/config.example.yaml config/config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml with your settings
```

## Usage

### 1. Data Collection
```bash
python src/data_collection/survey_generator.py
python src/data_collection/experiment_simulator.py
```

### 2. Data Analysis
```bash
# Run statistical analysis
python src/analysis/statistical_analysis.py

# Generate visualizations
python src/visualization/dashboard.py
```

### 3. ML Model Training
```bash
python src/models/train_vulnerability_predictor.py
```

### 4. Interactive Notebooks
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/
```

## Key Features

### Data Collection
- Automated survey generation
- Phishing scenario simulations
- Real-time experiment tracking
- Demographic data collection

### Statistical Analysis

## Research Methodology

### Mixed Methods Approach
1. **Quantitative**: Survey data (n=300+ professionals)
2. **Experimental**: Simulated phishing scenarios
3. **Qualitative**: Semi-structured interviews (n=20)

### Data Collection Timeline
- **Phase 1** (Weeks 1-4): Survey deployment and baseline data
- **Phase 2** (Weeks 5-8): Phishing simulations
- **Phase 3** (Weeks 9-12): Training intervention
